# ASPDotNetTodos-React
React is a very popular JavaScript library used to build web application. In this project, we use ASP.NET Core and React to build a Todo list web application. 
Particularly, we use Ant Design which is a rich React UI library that contains a set of high quality components to built user interfaces. On the backend side, 
ASP.NET Core API 6 is a good candidate for building the Web API for the project.
